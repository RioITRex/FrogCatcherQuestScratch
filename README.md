# FrogCatcherQuestScratch
Week 0 of Harvard CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science Scratch Project

This is a quest-based Scratch project where you interact with a goblin by advancing dialogue using the space bar. 
If you choose to accept the quest, your task is to catch three frogs and return them to the goblin to complete it.
